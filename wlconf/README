EXAMPLES
--------

* Get the value of phy_standalone in the phy struct inside wl18xx from
  the binary configuration file wl18xx-conf.bin in the current
  directory:

  # ./wlconf -i wl18xx-conf.bin -g wl18xx.phy.phy_standalone
  wl18xx.phy.phy_standalone = 0x00

* Set the window_size value in the hangover struct inside core, using
  the binary at /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity/wl18xx-conf.bin as input
  and writing the modified file into wl18xx-conf.bin in the local
  directory (default output location):

  # ./wlconf -i /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity/wl18xx-conf.bin -s core.hangover.window_size=0x20



KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS
----------------------------

* Only the first struct in an array of structs can be set;

* It's not possible to set or print an entire structure at once;

* The dump and print commands are buggy;

* It's too cumbersome and prone to errors to let the end-users parse
  the source header file.  Thus, a default struct.bin file with the
  current driver configuration structure is provided.  This binary
  should be updated here whenever the conf header files change in the
  driver code.

* The source header parser is very limited.  It doesn't do a full
  pre-processing, but matches on regular expressions.  The format of
  the file must be very strict;

* The source header parser can't expand macros or enums.  These
  symbols need to be translated manually and changed in the header
  file;

* The source header parser can't include other files (ie. the #include
  statements are ignored), so it's best to copy the hw-specific header
  (eg. wl18xx/conf.h) into the core header file (ie. wlcore/conf.h)
  and substitute the priv[0] with the name of the top priv structure
  (eg. wl18xx_priv_conf);



TODO
----

* Allow setting values in any structure inside an array of structs;

* Fix print and dump;

* Add INI file parser for setting multiple values at once;

* Improve type-checking in the --set command;

* Allow setting all values in an array with the --set command;

* Allow setting a value in a specific index of an array;

* Implement a man page;

* Split into separate source files;

* Implement "expert-mode" or something that doesn't make it so easy
  for end-users to mangle with the source header parsing and
  generation of struct binaries;

* Improve checking of options that are allowed with each different
  command;

* Fix some compiler warnings on x86 and make sure it works well;

* Add checksum to the generated configuration binary;

* Use the version, magic number from the header file;

* Add option to change the root structure;
